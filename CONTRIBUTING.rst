Contributing to NCPA
====================

We are always happy to get pull request for really anything that will help make this project great. 
Bug fixes and feature requests require a bit more effort to get included but if you follow this then your 
pull request should get included in no time.

Note that you don't need to know how to write Python in order to contribute! Testing our latest builds in 
your environment is also extremely helpful. Any information on problems you face could help us make NCPA
even better.

Create Your Repo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create your own fork on GitHub to commit your changes to. You may want to use your own branch once you fork 
to make multiple pull requests easier.

Build Your Development Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to get your NCPA development environment up and running you need to make sure all the pre-reqs have 
been installed and working.

**Set Up Linux Environment**

    cd ncpa
    ./build/scripts/linux_build_prereqs.sh
    ./build/scripts/linux_build_setup.sh

Create Readable Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please follow `PEP8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ as close as possible, however it is not 
a requirement to get your code into NCPA. We will work with you to fix any issues that we see that involve 
PEP8 or our own styling guidelines.

Does It Work?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Be sure to thoroughly test your code. We do not have full tests set up yet and without them, we need to 
be sure that each pull request does not break functionality. We can help you with this, but please make 
sure to verify your code before submitting your pull requst.

Send Us A Pull Request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The easist way to do this is from inside `GitHub <https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/>`_ 
but you can also run it from the command line.
