<h1>Configuration</h1>
<p>NCPA should start working right out of the box. However, to tailor it to your needs and for security reasons, you should at least change the API&#8217;s community string for non-Windows installations.</p>
<p>If you wish to send passive results, you will also need to specify additional information related to passive checks to the configuration file.</p>
<p>This document is meant to be a reference as to what these directives mean, not necessarily a friendly way to define them.</p>
<p>One last item that should be noted is that you do not need to restart the NCPA server upon changing any of the configuration used by the passive agent. Every time the passive agent wakes up, it re-parses its configuration file. However, for the active agent there are some items that are parsed once at service start, mainly the section named &#8216;[listener]&#8217;. For this reason you should restart the NCPA service if you want to reflect the changes made for active checks.</p>
<div class="section" id="config-file-location">
<h2>Config File Location</h2>
<p>In order to configure NCPA, you will need to edit its configuration file, which is kept on the file system.</p>
<p>Windows keeps this file at:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre>
<span class="n">C</span><span class="p">:</span>\<span class="n">Program</span> <span class="n">Files</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x86</span><span class="p">)</span>\<span class="n">Nagios</span>\<span class="n">NCPA</span>\<span class="n">etc</span>\<span class="n">ncpa</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">cfg</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Linux keeps this file at:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">usr</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">local</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">ncpa</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">etc</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">ncpa</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">cfg</span>

<p>Once you have located this file, you can start editing it. This file is a standard INI file.</p>

<div class="section" id="config-file-directives">
<h2>Config File Directives</h2>
<p>Lets take a look at some of the directives in a the configuration file. Note that the config file is sectioned off by the square brackets. These different sections affect different portions of NCPA&#8217;s operation.</p>
<p>We will break the configuration file down by section.</p>

    <div class="alert alert-info">
        <b>Note</b> You might notice that there appears to be duplicate entries. For instance, both [listener] and [passive] sections have a specification for <em>logfile</em>. They maintain separate log files as they are considered two different processes and are treated as such.
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="listener">
        <h3>[listener]</h3>
        <p>This section controls NCPA&#8217;s active check settings including how you actively connect to this agent to ask it for information. NCPA starts up an HTTP server to handle Nagios requests which makes much of the specification in this section relevant to that server.</p>
