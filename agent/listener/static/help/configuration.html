                <h1>Configuration</h1>
                <p>On a successful install, NCPA will start working right out of the box. However, to tailor it to your needs, you will want to edit the configuration. You can set up NCPA security and web GUI settings, along with configuring passive check settings.</p>
                <p>This is meant to be a reference for all the configuration options available. Some configuration options are required, while others are just optional. We recommend keeping the configuration options that are defined by default, and tweaking them to your desired configuration. Doing it this way ensures that all non-default options will be defined.</p>
                <p>After editing the configuration, you must <a href="index.html#restarting-ncpa">restart the <em>NCPA Passive</em> and <em>NCPA Listener</em> services</a> to apply the new configuration.</p>
                <p>
                    <div class="alert alert-info">
                        <b>Note</b>: On Linux and Mac OS X, the default API token is set to <em>mytoken</em> and you will want to change this after install. Windows sets the token on install based on user input in the installer.

                    <h2>Config Locations</h2>
                    <p>In order to configure NCPA, you will need to edit its configuration file, which is kept on the file system. On a default install, most of the configuration will be located in the <code>ncpa.cfg</code> file in the following directories on the selected operating system:</p>
                    <ul class="nav nav-tabs" role="tablist">
                        <li role="presentation" class="active"><a href="#windows" role="tab" data-toggle="tab"><i class="fa fa-windows fa-l fa-14"></i> Windows</a></li>

                    </ul>
                    <div class="tab-content">
                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane active" id="windows"><pre>C:\Program Files (x86)\Nagios\NCPA\etc\</pre></div>
                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="linux"><pre>/usr/local/ncpa/etc/</pre></div>

                    </div>
                    <p>As of NCPA 2, there is also an <code>ncpa.cfg.d</code> folder which follows the standard of including all <b>.cfg</b> files inside of it into the main <code>nagios.cfg</code> when parsing the configuration. Another change to the way configuration works in NCPA 2 is that changing the passive check configuration <em>requires a restart of the NCPA Passive service</em>. By default NCPA 2 will have an <code>example.cfg</code> file in <code>ncpa.cfg.d</code> directory on Linux and Mac OS X systems. On windows, you are able to select whether or not you are going to enable NRDP during the install - including setting up your basic default checks - placed in <code>nrdp.cfg</code> in <code>nrdp.cfg.d</code>.</p>

                    <h2>Config Option Reference</h2>
                    <p>Below is a list of all available options for the configuration file. The configuration is a standard INI-style config using the <code>name = value</code> notation. However, note that the config file is sectioned off by the square brackets. These different sections affect different portions of NCPA's operation. Each section is seperately listed below.</p>

For instance, both <a href="#listener">[listener]</a> and <a href="#passive">[passive]</a> sections have a specification for <code>logfile</code>.

                    <p>This section is for the <em>NCPA Listener</em> service. It controls the web GUI, external authentication, the external API location, graphing integration, and active check settings. The <em>NCPA Listener</em> also runs an HTTP server to handle the API requests for both the API, GUI, and graphing sections. For this reason, this section is the only one that will require an address and a port to listen on.</p>

                                    This is where the magic happens with the NCPA passive agent. Handlers are items that are run whenever the passive daemon wakes up. The currently supported handlers are nrds and nrdp. This handlers list should be a comma-delimited list of handlers that are to be run. To run both nrds and nrdp handlers, this entry would be <em>handlers = nrds,nrdp</em>. More information is provided about what each of these handlers do under the <a class="reference internal" href="#nrds">[nrds]</a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#nrdp">[nrdp]</a> sections, respectively.

This allows for you to have a chain of NRDP forwards if firewall constraints are incredibly heavy.</td>
